These programs created printed blocks
The 1st program uses brute force to create a 2 x 2 grid block matching the instructions image.
The 2nd program creates the same grid as program except it uses functions to create the grid block.
The 3rd program is a general grid block printer using user inputs to determine the size of the grid blocks. Max size is 5 x 5.
